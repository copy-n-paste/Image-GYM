# 🧪 TheShrinkLab

**Where bloated files go to get scientifically slimmed down.**

Welcome to TheShrinkLab — the top-secret facility where heavy, lazy, oversized files are put on a digital treadmill and come out looking tight and tiny. 

Whether it's a chunky image, a thicc PDF, or some mystery file you found in "Downloads (32)", this lab helps it lose *byte-weight* — with no crash diets or regrets.

## 🤖 What It Does

- 📸 Compresses bloated image files into lean, upload-friendly beauties.
- 📄 Whispers sweet nothings to PDFs until they agree to shrink.
- 🧠 Knows when to show smart options (image sliders, PDF levels, etc.).
- 📊 Progress bar so satisfying, you’ll pretend it’s hacking the Pentagon.
- 🪄 Magic logging terminal tells you everything it's doing, step-by-step.
- 🧼 Non-destructive — your original file remains untouched, just in case it sues.

## 🛠️ Tech Inside the Lab

- `tkinter` – Because web apps are for extroverts.
- `Pillow` – For squishing images without drama.
- `PyMuPDF` – Helps your PDFs get over their attachment issues.
- `threading` – So your GUI doesn’t freeze harder than your brain on Monday morning.

## 🧪 How to Use This Science

1. Open the app (`python main.py`).
2. Click "🔍 Select File". Choose something bloated.
3. Adjust compression settings (or trust the defaults, we won’t judge).
4. Click "🚀 Compress File".
5. Celebrate your file's glow-up.

## 🎯 Supported File Types

| Type        | Action                           |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, etc. | Custom image compression with quality control. |
| `.pdf`      | PyMuPDF-powered shrink ray. |
| `.doc`, `.docx`, others | Light copy-compression (like a polite rename). |

## 📥 Installation

Install the only two brain cells this app needs:

```bash
pip install pillow
pip install PyMuPDF
````

Then run the app:

```bash
python main.py
```

Boom. You’re now the head of shrink operations.

## 🧽 Reset Button

Made a horrible file choice? Click the **🗑️ Clear** button to pretend it never happened. Poof.

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* **Image Compression**: Lower the quality, smaller the size. But don't go too far — unless you like that early-2000s webcam vibe.
* **PDFs**: Choose from Low (thicc), Medium (balanced), or High (streamlined like a PDF on a juice cleanse).
* **Other Files**: They just get renamed and feel important.

## 🧞 Magic, But Real

This app doesn’t upload your files, doesn’t snoop, and doesn’t sell your data to mysterious AI lords. It's all local. Like grandma’s cooking, but for compression.

## 📄 License

MIT — which means do what you want, and if it breaks your computer... well, it won’t. Probably.

## 🌈 Closing Words

✨ *Every file deserves a second chance to be skinny.*
✨ *Don’t delete — compress.*
✨ *TheShrinkLab — the glow-up your hard drive deserves.*
